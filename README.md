#### Notes
I prefer Disqus for comments both as a blogger and a reader of blogs. So, this theme does not contain much of native WordPress comment support- they work, but they're not pretty. For this first release, I preferred to spend time fixing other things. Better comments are coming in the next relase.

This is a work in progress, and major changes may be made frequently. If you don't want to bother with diff and merging changes, I suggest adding your changes to a custom stylesheet (custom.css is provided) and not modifying the core files except the changes listed below: 

* Put your own profile photo named profile_rounded.png in images folder.

* Open header.php, uncomment and add your Github, Linkedin and Twitter links. Also uncomment the h2 tag if you need a linked site title.

####Credits
Uses [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for a few icons, but it has an extensive collection of icons, so you can add any icons you need. Hit the link for documentation and examples.
