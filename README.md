### Notes
I prefer Disqus for comments both as a blogger and a reader of blogs. So, this theme does not contain much of native WordPress comment support- they work, but they're not pretty.

Add your changes to a custom stylesheet (custom.css is provided).

Add your own profile photo named profile_rounded.png in images folder.

Open header.php, uncomment and add your Github, Linkedin and Twitter links. Also uncomment the h2 tag if you need a linked site title.

### Credits
Uses [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for a few icons, but it has an extensive collection of icons, so you can add any icons you need. Hit the link for documentation and examples.
